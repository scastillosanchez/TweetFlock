# TweetFlock
Culmination of various labs from ITWS 4500 - Web Science Systems Development into one web application called TweetFlock!

Uses the Twitter API to collect tweets from a form query, puts them into a MongoDB database, and will allow for the user to read the tweets from the MongoDB Atlas server and/or download a file (JSON, CSV, XML) with the tweet content.

Enjoy!
